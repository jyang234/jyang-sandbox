Hey there! My name is John Yang and I am a software engineer/cloud ninja on the weekdays (level: journeyman), adventurer on the weekends (and occasionally the extended weekend, boss permitting). I love to travel! I find that you can learn the most about a culture simply from eating and drinking your way through it. My goal is to travel to all seven continents at some point in my life. On weekends you can often find me hiking/biking all over Virginia, or at one of the many amazing breweries in Richmond! More likely than not though, you'll find me with my friends.

I've sort of stumbled into the software scene by accident, you might say. My degree from Penn State is in Management Information Systems, which was glorified technical project management (at the time, not sure if they've changed up the curriculum at all). Up to the second year of my professional career, I've only been in almost exclusively project management roles at GE. It was by chance that I seized an opportunity to take on a developer role on a project that I was managing. That was a huge turning point in both my career and my life, because now I am extremely passionate about learning new technologies and becoming a better full-stack software engineer.

That's enough about me for now! Check back regularly if you wish to follow me on my adventures! Also feel free to follow me on any of my other social media homes (links in the Contact area)!

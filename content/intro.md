### Hello friends from the internet!   
Welcome to my little home in the clouds. Unfortunately, it is not really an ideal place to raise a family. I'm a software engineer/cloud ninja on the weekdays (level: journeyman), adventurer on the weekends (and occasionally the extended weekend, boss permitting).

*This is me pretending to be super active in the Outer Banks, NC.*

Here, you will be able to join in my adventures, both virtual and geographical, as I will be posting as regularly as I feel like it! I will share with you all the cool stuff that I learn at work/home as well as my experiences from journeys near and far.

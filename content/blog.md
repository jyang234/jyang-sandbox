###### First post!

This is exciting, my very first blog post ever on my very first blog! Blogging seemed huge in the 2000's, but now everyone's on twitter and instagram - all about bite-sized sharing of thoughts. I've wondered if this is a commentary on our generation's collective decline of attention span. But then again, less can sometimes be more as I've come to find! This is all a very new experience for me as well, so I'll let you know later how I feel about microblogging vs straight up blogging.

As you can probably tell, I am an avid skiier! I am totally on the fence on whether or not I should buy myself an [epic pass](https://www.epicpass.com/passes/epic-local-pass.aspx#/). For less than $700, you'd be able to ski at some of the best ski resorts in the US and some Europe/Japan/Canada. This seems steep from a glance, but if you consider a 5 day pass at Breckenridge being around the same price it's actually not a bad deal. Plus, you get 6 SWAF (Ski With A Friend) passes loaded in, so this is gonna come through huge when I decide to take my girlfriend on a ski vacation.

Thats all I've got on my mind currently, hope that was worthy of a first post! Check back soon for more musings and thoughts that nobody asked for!
